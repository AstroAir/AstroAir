I'm **Max Qian** — a passionate developer with a deep love for the stars 🌌 and clean, efficient code. My mission is to bridge the gap between astronomy and software by building open-source tools that empower researchers, educators, and fellow stargazers.

🔭 **Astronomy** isn’t just a hobby for me—it’s a lens through which I view problem-solving. Whether it’s simulating celestial mechanics or processing telescope data, I thrive on turning cosmic curiosity into functional software.

## 🔍 What I’m Up To

- 🤔 **Exploring** emerging technologies and crafting practical software solutions—sometimes with a quick hack, sometimes with elegant architecture.
- 🌱 **Deepening my knowledge** in **System Design**, **Advanced Algorithms**, and **High-Performance Computing**—because the universe doesn’t wait, and neither should our code.
- ✍️ **C++ Development** and **Competitive Programming** are my go-to playgrounds for sharpening logic and performance intuition.
- ⭐ **Primary Focus**: Building and contributing to **astronomical software**—from data pipelines to visualization tools and simulation engines.

## 🌟 Open Source & Collaboration

I believe in the power of **open collaboration**. Most of my projects are open-source, and I warmly welcome contributions, suggestions, or even just a friendly chat about astronomy or algorithms!

👉 **Feel free to:**

- 🌱 **Star** a repo you find useful  
- 💬 **Open an issue** if you spot a bug or have an idea  
- 🤝 **Fork & contribute** to make our tools better together

## 📬 Let’s Connect

While I spend most of my time under the stars (or in front of a terminal), I’m always open to meaningful conversations—whether it’s about orbital mechanics, optimizing a C++ loop, or the latest in telescope tech.

✨ *There’s always someone who will look at the starry sky with you.*  
And maybe, that someone could be me.
